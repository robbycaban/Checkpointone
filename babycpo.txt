What are comments? Commenting involves placing Human Readable Descriptions inside of computer programs detailing what the Code is doing
2.This is a single line comment in python
print("Pythonforbeginners.com") #This is also a python comment

Multi line strings in python can be used as multi line comments if they are not assigned to variables. When the string isnâ€™t assigned to any variable, they are parsed and evaluated by the interpreter but no byte code is generated because no address can be assigned to the strings. Effectively the unassigned multi line string works as a multi line comment.

which expands to many lines"""
